### Description
```
This resource is prereleased untested and still under developement this is by no means complete and any contributions would be highly appreciated! I havent made much open source lately and am hoping i dont get too much negativity on the incomplete release but I will continue coming back to this resource and start making it bigger and better.
```
```
### Future Plans / Stuff to do
```
-- do an insert/update for fueltype in db XD
-- Nothing at all has been tested 
-- still need to add spill functions
-- add all the pumps in the city
-- add fuel job [non-whitelist] (haven't even started yet)
-- figure a workaround for item info for esx inventories and get a full conversion going
-- props and prop placement for filling gas cans
```
```
### Dependencies
```
if using QBCore config then
	-qb-core
	-qb-menu
	-qb-input
	-qb-inventory -- or any inventory that stores item info 
	-interact-sound -- use the sound from in the sound folder or a sound of your own!
-- if recoding for another inventory do a pull request with a conversion for your used inventory so i can offer config options to the community!
